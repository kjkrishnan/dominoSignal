\title{Turn domino object signaling information into a data frame}
\usage{
network_to_df(
  dom,
  send_clusters = NULL,
  rec_clusters = NULL,
  exp_type = c("counts", "z_scores")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dom}{A domino object}

\item{send_clusters}{Cluster name(s) for which the outgoing signal is desired}

\item{rec_clusters}{Cluster name(s) for which incoming signal is desired}

\item{exp_type}{A character vector of length 1, either "counts" or "z_scores", to indicate desired
expression type}
}
\value{
A data.frame of signaling information, with columns for ligand, receptor,
transcription factor, ligand expression, receptor expression,
transcription factor expression, sending cluster, and receiving cluster
}
\description{
This function takes a domino object and returns a data frame of signaling information with
columns for ligand, receptor, transcription factor, ligand expression, receptor expression,
transcription factor expression, sending cluster, and receiving cluster. Expression values are
averaged counts across cells in a given cluster (sending for the ligand, receiving for the receptor
and transcription factor).

\examples{
data("pbmc_dom_tiny_built")
df <- network_to_df(pbmc_dom_tiny_built, exp_type = "z_scores")
head(df)
